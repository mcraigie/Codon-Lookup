Usage:
  (output-codons-to-csv <input> <file-path> <append-stop>)

  <input> is the string of amino acids to be processed. E.g. "MDLKKHIMCPRT"
          Any characters in the string that do not represent an amino acid will be ignored
  <file-path> is the location and name of the .csv to be created
  <append-stop> when not-nil will add a column of stop codons to the end of the resulting table
